THE SECURITY LEVEL OF HOME WI-FI NETWORKS AGAINST PASSWORD ATTACKS 

# Abstract  

The escalating use of Wi-Fi technology has raised concerns due to network security issues that often receive inadequate attention. Despite Yogyakarta's status as a city with the highest digital literacy index and its smart  city program initiatives, there is no guaranteed security regarding these problems. This research aims to assess the security level of home Wi-Fi networks against password attacks for statistical data and educational purposes. The sampling method employed was quota sampling, with penetration testing used as the data  collection method. The research results indicate that WPA cracking and WPS cracking attacks successfully  obtained a small portion of login credentials in the form of passwords, and measured the percentage of security levels at the city level and in each sub-district. In addition to the attack data, several recommendations are provided to protect access points from these attacks.  

**Keywords**: Wi-Fi, password attack, WPA cracking, WPS cracking

# Result

Based on the test results, the following are the key findings of this study:

## Percentage of Urban Security

Overall, the security level of home Wi-Fi networks in Yogyakarta City against password attacks reached **84.44%**. This figure indicates that the majority of sampled Access Points (APs) have a reasonably good level of security.

## Percentage of Security per Sub-district

The level of security varied across each sub-district:

- Sub-district with the **Highest** Security: Pakualaman (100%)

- Sub-district with the **Lowest** Security: Kraton (60%)
