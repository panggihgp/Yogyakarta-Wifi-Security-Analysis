# About

[Wifite](https://github.com/derv82/wifite) is an **automated** Python tool used for auditing wireless networks. It's designed to be a simple, **all-in-one solution** for ethical hackers and penetration testers to find and exploit common vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi security protocols.

## Key Features and Functionality

Wifite works by automating several well-known wireless hacking tools, such as `Aircrack-ng`, to perform various attacks in a single script. 

Its main functionalities include:

1. Target Scanning: It automatically scans for nearby wireless access points.

2. Vulnerability Detection: It identifies the security protocol used by each network (WEP, WPA/WPA2, WPS).

3. Automated Attacks: Depending on the detected protocol, Wifite can launch a variety of automated attacks:

    - **WEP Cracking**: It can capture WEP packets and use an algorithm to quickly crack the password.
    - **WPA/WPA2 Handshake Capture**: It automates the process of deauthenticating connected clients to capture the WPA/WPA2 4-way handshake, which can then be cracked offline.
    - **WPS Attack**: It can perform a brute-force attack on the WPS PIN to gain access to the network.

## Attack requirements

Requirements that I used in this research were:

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Kali Linux Image](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
3. Wireless Network Adapter TP Link TL WN722n 1.10 version + its [driver](https://youtu.be/RJbc6mUZE0s?si=UY-qYhacxSYfNzzp) on Windows
4. Custom dictionary attack for indonesians' common passwords

## Changing and adding wordlist dictionary

By default, wifite uses wordlist-probable.txt to bruteforce handshake file captured using WPA attack. This dictionary contains more than 200k common passwords which spend 3 minutes to match the whole list using my laptop. I have added 700 passwords to my personal wordlist that I consider to be commonly used by Indonesians, in order to increase the success rate.

- Create your own dictionary, make sure it contains passwords with local language words

- Copy the content of the dictionary to wifite's default dictionary (wordlist-probable.txt)

  ```
  sudo nano /usr/share/dict/wordlist-probable.txt
  ```
- If you expect to use larger dictionary such as rockyou.txt which contains 14 million passowords, you can manually utilize `aircrack-ng` or `hashcat` to bruteforce the handshake file.

## Attack process

### 1. Going to a place that have been planned before (Ex. at Uzlifatul Jannah Mosque, in Warungboto Village)
