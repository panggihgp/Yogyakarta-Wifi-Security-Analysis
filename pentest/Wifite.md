# About

[Wifite](https://github.com/derv82/wifite) is an **automated** Python tool used for auditing wireless networks. It's designed to be a simple, **all-in-one solution** for ethical hackers and penetration testers to find and exploit common vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi security protocols.

## Key Features and Functionality

Wifite works by automating several well-known wireless hacking tools, such as `Aircrack-ng`, to perform various attacks in a single script. 

Its main functionalities include:

1. Target Scanning: It automatically scans for nearby wireless access points.

2. Vulnerability Detection: It identifies the security protocol used by each network (WEP, WPA/WPA2, WPS).

3. Automated Attacks: Depending on the detected protocol, Wifite can launch a variety of automated attacks:

    - **WEP Cracking**: It can capture WEP packets and use an algorithm to quickly crack the password.
    - **WPA/WPA2 Handshake Capture**: It automates the process of deauthenticating connected clients to capture the WPA/WPA2 4-way handshake, which can then be cracked offline.
    - **WPS Attack**: It can perform a brute-force attack on the WPS PIN to gain access to the network.

## Attack requirements

Requirements that I used in this research were:

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Kali Linux Image](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
3. Wireless Network Adapter TP Link TL WN722n 1.10 version + its [driver](https://youtu.be/RJbc6mUZE0s?si=UY-qYhacxSYfNzzp) on Windows
4. Custom dictionary attack for indonesians' common passwords

## Attack process
